# Mustachio
These files were from a semester-long group project for one of my classes. We set out to make a Mario-esque platform game that
included multiplayer and a level creator. Unfortunately we were told about halfway through our project to redo things and we didn't
get the level editor implemented. The multiplayer still works if one computer hosts and another joins, though from what we tested
it is very slow. The game should still be able to run normally, but in order to play the one level we made you must choose "New Game"
and select the Game Files folder that pops up to load the actual level.
Most of my responsibilities for this project revolved around making the assets and testing the multiplayer.
